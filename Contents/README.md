This script is an add-in for Fusion 360 that autogenerates labels for Gridfinity Bins by Pred.
If you wish to contribute, for the moment just fork the repository or message me.

v5.1 was the lastest version of the script but in starting version control for this project I created a new script with the same name as this repository to act as the new root script.
