## Creating Branches

Consistantly naming your branches helps eliminate confusion and informs contributors what the focus of your branch is.

Branch names shall follow these guidlines:

- Branch name shall be all lowercase.
- Branch name shall not be longer than necessary, keep it to just a few words.
- Branch name shall reflect what the focus of the branch is. For example, a branch focusing on implementing a UI could be named `implement-ui`.

> - Make it _lowercase_
> - Keep it ~short~
> - Make it **informative**

## File Naming Conventions

### Python Files

Python files shall follow PEP-8 guildines.

The official style guide is available on the official [Python Website](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

The following shall be followed without exception:

- Names shall follow the [Descriptive Naming Styles](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#descriptive-naming-styles)

  > The following naming styles are commonly distinguished:
  >
  > - `b` (single lowercase letter)
  > - `B` (single uppercase letter)
  > - `lowercase`
  > - `lower_case_with_underscores`
  > - `UPPERCASE`
  > - `UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES`
  > - `CapitalizedWords` (or CapWords, or CamelCase – so named because of the bumpy look of its letters [4]). This is also sometimes known as StudlyCaps.
  >
  >   Note: When using acronyms in CapWords, capitalize all the letters of the acronym. Thus HTTPServerError is better than HttpServerError.
  >
  > - `mixedCase` (differs from CapitalizedWords by initial lowercase character!)
  > - `Capitalized_Words_With_Underscores` (ugly!)

  > In addition, the following special forms using leading or trailing underscores are recognized (these can generally be combined with any case convention):
  >
  > - `_single_leading_underscore`: weak “internal use” indicator. E.g. `from M import *` does not import objects whose names start with an underscore.
  > - `single_trailing_underscore_`: used by convention to avoid conflicts with Python keyword, e.g. :
  >   `tkinter.Toplevel(master, class_='ClassName')`
  > - `__double_leading_underscore`: when naming a class attribute, invokes name mangling (inside class FooBar, `__boo` becomes `_FooBar__boo`; see below).
  > - `\__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__`: “magic” objects or attributes that live in user-controlled namespaces. E.g. `\__init__`, `\__import__` or `\__file__`. Never invent such names; only use them as documented.

## Quarantined Files

The following files were autogenerated by Fusion 360 and VSCode and should not be modified unless you know what you're doing:

1. [lib\fusionAddInUtils\ ]()
2. [NewAddIn2.manifest]()
3. [JFM-Proj-006_GridfinityLabelExpansionPackGenerationScript.code-workspace]()
4. [config.py]()
5. [.env]()
6. [commands\ ]()
7. [commands\commandDialog\ ]()
8. [commands\paletteSend\ ]()
9. [commands\paletteShow\ ]()
10. [commands\\\_\_init\_\_.py]()
11. [.vscode\ ]()

## INSTALLATION

This add-in should be installed in
`C:\Users\[%%your-username%%]\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\AddIns\`

## Definition List

Autogenerator Parameter, Autogen Parameter
: > Parameters defined by inputs to the `GridfinityLabelAutogen` add-in via `command inputs`.

Gridfinity Grid Unit (GGU)
: > `Gridfinity Grid Units`, or `GGU`, are a measure of length using the square grid of Gridfinity as its base unit.
One `GGU` is equal to one Gridfinity square.

User parameter
: > Parameters defined in an `.f3d` document. Easily accessed via the API and allows creating parametric designs.
